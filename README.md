# Arabic Dialect Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying Arabic dialects using machine learning techniques. It includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning text data (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.).
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF transformation for text representation.
- **Model Training**: Uses logistic regression and other classifiers with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Data Visualization**: Plots for data insights.

## 🚀 Installation
To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arabic-dialect-classifier.git
   cd arabic-dialect-classifier
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📊 Usage
Run the main script to preprocess data and train the model:
```bash
python main.py
```
